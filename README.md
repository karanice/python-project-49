### Technologies

This project is made with Poetry. It uses such libraries as prompt, sys, random, operator, math.
Flake8 is used for linting.


### Description

This project is a set of math games:

1. brain-even is a game, where you need to select whether a given number is even or not.
2. brain-calc is a game, where you need to calculate the expression.
3. brain-gcd is a game, where you need to find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers.
4. brain-prime is a game, where you need to select whether a given number is prime or not.
5. brain-progression is a game, where you need to fill the gap in a given progression formulated by specific rule.

All games contain three rounds, any mistake ends the game.
